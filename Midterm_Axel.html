         <h3>1945</h3>
            <p>Vannevar Bush Writes an <a  style="color: #40fc59" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/">article</a> about a photo-electrical-mechanical device called a Memex, for memory extension, which could make and follow links between documents on mucrofiche.</p>
       
         <h3>1960s</h3>
            <p>Dough Engelbart prototypes an "oNLine System" (NLS) which does hypertext browsing, editing, and email.</p>
            <p>Ted Nelson coins the word <b>Hypertext</b> in <i>A Files Structure for the Complex, the Changing, and the Inderterminate.</i> presented at 20th National Conference of the Association for Computing Machinery.</p>
       
         <h3>1980s</h3>
           <p>Sir Tim Berners-Lee is working at CERN and notices that scientist are having trouble sharing information:</p>

              <ul> 
                <i>In those days,  there was different information on different computers, but you had to log on different computers to get at it. Also, sometimes you had to learn a different program on each computer. Oftern it was just easier to go and ask people when they were having coffee...</i>
              </ul>

            <p>He <a style="color: rgb(72, 255, 72)" href="https://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html">conceives</a>  his bosses that it is a good idea. Believe it or not, they are lukewarm about it at first!</p> 

         <h3>1990s</h3>
           <p>You can find out more <a style="color: #40fc59" href=" https://www.w3.org/History.html">here</a></p>
           <p>And remember: The Internet and World Wide Web and not one and the same. You can learn about history of the Internet <a style="color:#40fc59" href="http://www2.law.columbia.edu/donnelly/lda/ih/techprofx.html">here</a></p>

         <h3>The First Web Site</h3>
           <p>The first website at CERN - and in the world - was dedicated to the World Wide Web project itself and was hosted on Berners-Less's NeXT computer. It has been restored at its <a style="color:#40fc59" href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">original address</a>.</p>
